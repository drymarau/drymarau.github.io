This is a test post to see how the theme looks.

## Here's some heading

And even a bit of code:

```kotlin
fun main() {
    val teams = buildList {
        add("Mercedes")
        add("Red Bull")
        add("Mclaren")
    }
    teams.forEach(::println)
}
```

Even some bullet points:

* Lewis Hamilton
* Max Verstappen
* George Russell
* Lando Norris
